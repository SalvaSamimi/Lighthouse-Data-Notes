### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

Example: Write a Python code to determin a number is positive, negativ, or zero.

```python
x=10
if x>0:
    print('Positive')
elif x<0:
    print('Negative')
else:
     print('Zero')

```
